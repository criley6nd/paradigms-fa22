Array comprehension is a way to perform operations on arrays in simpler ways than a standard for loop.
When given an array of NFL players, array comprehension can be used to filter the array for players on a certain
team. 
code:

```
players = [
    {name: 'DK'
    team: 'seattle'},
    {name: 'Geno'
    team: 'seattle'},
    {name: 'Russel'
    team: 'denver'},
]

seahawks = (p.name for p in players when p.team == 'seattle')

for player in seahawks
    console.log player
```
