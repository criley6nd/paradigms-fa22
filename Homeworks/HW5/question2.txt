The css needs to be loaded in before the page is rendered to take effect so it is important to call
it in the header before any of the page is rendered. Putting the js at the end allows you to run 
functions on the entirety of the page. If it were in the middle, all elements may not be rendered
yet so some elements that were meant to be changed do not get chenged. The js can only make changes
to rendered sections of the page.
