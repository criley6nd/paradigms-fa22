The regular script tag is run in the order that it is in the html. If it is placed before an element
it will be run to completion before the next element is rendered. Asyc scripts start running in the
order they are placed, but they are run asynchronously so the page continues to render while the 
async stricpt runs in the background. Defer scripts run after the entire page is rendered regaurdless of
where they are placed.
