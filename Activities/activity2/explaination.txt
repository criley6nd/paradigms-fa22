let firstName = "";
let lastName = "";
let nickName = "JCSS";
console.log( firstName || lastName || nickName || "Anonymous");
console.log( firstName || lastName || nickName && "Anonymous");

firstName || lastName || nickName || "Anonymous" returns "JCSS" because it evaluates the statement from left
to right until it reaches a true value. Because firstName and lastName are falsy values, the first truthy
value is nickName so nickName is returned.

firstName || lastName || nickName && "Anonymous" returns "Anonymous" because the ||'s are evaluated left to
right, but the && is evaluated first. The && takes the last truthy value because it evaluates to true
causing the value of the && to be "Anonymous". The equation can now be rewritten as:

firstName || lastName || "Anonymous" 

The first truthy value from this equation is "Anonymous" and that is reutrned.
