Compile means to take the code and put it into machine code. This is what a C compiler does by converting the C code into 
an executable. Transpiling is taking code from one human readable language to another human readable langauge. In the 
example we are looking at, coffeescript is translated to javascript which is then translated to machine code. It is 
like a middle step.
